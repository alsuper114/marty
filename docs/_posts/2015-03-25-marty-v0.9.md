It's been 2 months since we first publicly announced Marty. Since then we've been working hard building new features and refining our API. Today I'm happy to announce Marty v0.9! So what's new in this release?

<h2 id="isomorphisim">Isomorphisim</h2>

Building isomorphic applications (Being able to run your JS application on the server or in the browser) has been one of the major reasons people have started using React. The problem was all of the current solutions we tried had lots of unanswered questions. How do I get state into my stores in a scalable way? How can I write my data fetching code so it runs on the server and in the browser? How do I integrate with libraries like [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) and [express.js](expressjs.com)? We've been thinking about these questions and think we have some good answers. You can read our [guide on isomorphism]({% url /guides/isomorphism/index.html %}) to learn more.

<h2 id="es6-classes">ES6 Classes</h2>

To complement React ability to define components using ES6 classes we now support defining all types using classes as well. You can read our guide on [ES6]({% url /guides/es6/index.html %}) to find out how to make the switch.

{% sample %}
classic
=======
var UsersStore = Marty.createStore({
  id: 'UsersStore',
  handlers: {
    addUser: Constants.RECEIVE_USER
  },
  getInitialState: function () {
    return [];
  },
  addUser: function (user) {
    this.state.push(user);
    this.hasChanged();
  }
});

es6
===
class UsersStore extends Marty.Store {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);
    this.state = [];
    this.handlers = {
      addUser: Constants.RECEIVE_USER
    };
  }
  addUser(user) {
    this.state.push(user);
    this.hasChanged();
  }
}

{% endsample %}

<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>

Mixins are so 2014, it's all about function composition now. We've introduce [``Marty.createContainer``]({% url /api/top-level-api/index.htm#createContainer %}) as a replacement for the [state mixin]({% url /guides/state-mixin/index.htm#createContainer %}) which also works with components defined using the classic ES5 style and ES6 classes.

{% highlight js %}
class User extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div className="User">{this.props.user}</div>;
  }
}

module.exports = Marty.createContainer(User, {
  listenTo: UserStore,
  fetch: {
    user() {
      return UserStore.for(this).getUser(this.props.id);
    }
  },
  failed(errors) {
    return <div className="User User-failedToLoad">{errors}</div>;
  },
  pending() {
    return this.done({
      user: {}
    });
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="queries">Queries</h2>

<p>
There was a lot of confusion about how to dispatch actions when fetching state. We're introducing <a href="{% url /guides/queries/index.html %}">Queries</a> which are responsible for coordinating getting new state from outside of the application. You can read <a href="{% url /guides/queries/index.html %}">our guide</a> to learn why they've been introduced.
</p>

{% sample %}
classic
=======
var UserQueries = Marty.createQueries({
  id: 'UserQueries',
  getUser: function (id) {
    this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_STARTING, id);
    UserAPI.getUser(id).then(function (res) {
      if (res.status === 200) {
        this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER, res.body, id);
      } else {
        this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_FAILED, id);
      }
    }.bind(this)).catch(function (err) {
      this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_FAILED, id, err);
    }.bind(this))
  }
});

es6
===
class UserQueries extends Marty.Queries {
  getUser(id) {
    this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_STARTING, id);
    UserAPI.getUser(id).then((res) => {
      if (res.status === 200) {
        this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER, res.body, id);
      } else {
        this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_FAILED, id);
      }
    }).catch((err) => this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_FAILED, id, err));
  }
}
{% endsample %}

<h2 id="defining-action-types">Defining action types</h2>

Our approach to defining [action creators](http://martyjs.org/v/0.8.15/guides/action-creators/index.html) was the source of many bugs and lots of confusion. We've got a new, simplified our approach which should resolve all of these issues.

{% sample %}
classic
=======
var UserConstants = Marty.createConstants(["UPDATE_EMAIL"]);

var UserActionCreators = Marty.createActionCreators({
  id: 'UserActionCreators',
  updateEmail: function (userId, email) {
    this.dispatch(UserConstants.UPDATE_EMAIL, userId, email)
  }
});
es6
===
var UserConstants = Marty.createConstants(["UPDATE_EMAIL"]);

class UserActionCreators extends Marty.ActionCreators {
  updateEmail(userId, email) {
    this.dispatch(UserConstants.UPDATE_EMAIL, userId, email)
  }
}
{% endsample %}

<h2 id="one-render-per-store">Components only re-rendered once per action</h2>

There was an [interesting discussion in the Flux panel at React Conf about batching store updates to improve performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTj4O7WJJ98&list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr#t=473). Marty now does this automatically for you so no matter how many times your store changes your components will only be re-rendered once per action.

<h2 id="developer-tools">Developer Tools</h2>

[Marty Developer Tools]({% url /guides/developer-rools/index.html %}) has been given an overhaul. It can now tell you things like what components re-rendered as a result of the action and which stores caused a component to re-render. It also gives you the ability to reset the applications state to a specific action (think ``get reset --hard actionId``).

<h2 id="lodash">lodash</h2>

Thanks to [@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton) we've moved from underscore.js to lodash (This is an internal change so wont effect you if you're using underscore in your application). This has resulted in a **6KB drop** in our gzipped file size. Unfortunately Marty has also grown by 6KB so Marty v0.9 is the same size as Marty v0.8.

<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>

For those currently using Marty v0.8, we've written a [guide for upgrading to v0.9]({% url /guides/upgrading/08_09.html %}).

###Breaking changes

``Store#setState`` has been renamed to [``Store#replaceState``]({% url /api/stores/index.html#replaceState %}). [``Store#setState``]({% url /api/stores/index.html#setState %}) will now merge the existing state with the new state. This is to more closely follow the React API.
