It's been 2 months since we first publicly announced Marty. Since then we've been working hard building new features and refining our API. Today I'm happy to announce Marty v0.9!

So what's new in this release?

<h2 id="isomorphisim">Isomorphisim</h2>

Being able to run your JS application on the server and in the browser has been one of the major reasons people have started using React. We've found it is still very challenging to build isomorphic applications and so we've built a set of APIs that make it easier.

[``Marty.renderToString``]({% url /api/top-level-api/index.html#renderToString %}) is a smarter version of [``React.renderToString``](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.rendertostring) which knows what state each component needs, fetches it for you and only then renders the component. It also gives you lots of diagnostic information to understand what Marty is doing on the server:

<a href="{% url /img/renderToString-diagnostics.png %}"><img src="{% url /img/renderToString-diagnostics.png %}" width="100%" alt="Marty Developer Tools"/></a>

We've also created [marty-express]({% url /guides/isomorphism/marty-express.html %}), a middleware for [express.js](expressjs.com) which consumes [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) routes so you don't have to have to duplicate your routes on the client and the server. It will also modify the [HTTP state source]({% url /api/state-sources/http.html %}) so that you can make the same HTTP requests on the server.

If you'd like to learn more, we've written a [guide]({% url /guides/isomorphism/index.html %}) on how to get started.

<h2 id="es6-classes">ES6 Classes</h2>

To complement React ability to define components using ES6 classes we now support defining all types using classes as well. You can read our guide on [ES6]({% url /guides/es6/index.html %}) to find out how to make the switch.

{% sample %}
classic
=======
var UsersStore = Marty.createStore({
  id: 'UsersStore',
  handlers: {
    addUser: Constants.RECEIVE_USER
  },
  getInitialState: function () {
    return [];
  },
  addUser: function (user) {
    this.state.push(user);
    this.hasChanged();
  }
});

es6
===
class UsersStore extends Marty.Store {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);
    this.state = [];
    this.handlers = {
      addUser: Constants.RECEIVE_USER
    };
  }
  addUser(user) {
    this.state.push(user);
    this.hasChanged();
  }
}

{% endsample %}

<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>

When defining components using ES6 classes you can no longer use mixins which means you won't be able to use the [state mixin]({% url /guides/state-mixin/index.html %}). A new pattern emerging is [to wrap your components in "container" components which do the work of mixins](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750). We're a big fan of this pattern and so we've introduced [``Marty.createContainer``]({% url /api/top-level-api/index.html#createContainer %}) which wraps your component with a component that does the same job as the [state mixin]({% url /guides/state-mixin/index.html %}). You can checkout our [containers guide]({% url /guides/containers/index.html %}) to learn more about them.

{% highlight js %}
class User extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div className="User">{this.props.user}</div>;
  }
}

module.exports = Marty.createContainer(User, {
  listenTo: UserStore,
  fetch: {
    user() {
      return UserStore.for(this).getUser(this.props.id);
    }
  },
  failed(errors) {
    return <div className="User User-failedToLoad">{errors}</div>;
  },
  pending() {
    return this.done({
      user: {}
    });
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="queries">Queries</h2>

<p>
There was a lot of confusion about how to dispatch actions when fetching state. We're introducing <a href="{% url /guides/queries/index.html %}">Queries</a> which are responsible for coordinating getting new state from outside of the application. You can read <a href="{% url /guides/queries/index.html %}">our guide</a> to learn why they've been introduced.
</p>

{% sample %}
classic
=======
var UserQueries = Marty.createQueries({
  id: 'UserQueries',
  getUser: function (id) {
    this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_STARTING, id);
    UserAPI.getUser(id).then(function (res) {
      if (res.status === 200) {
        this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER, res.body, id);
      } else {
        this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_FAILED, id);
      }
    }.bind(this)).catch(function (err) {
      this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_FAILED, id, err);
    }.bind(this))
  }
});

es6
===
class UserQueries extends Marty.Queries {
  getUser(id) {
    this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_STARTING, id);
    UserAPI.getUser(id).then((res) => {
      if (res.status === 200) {
        this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER, res.body, id);
      } else {
        this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_FAILED, id);
      }
    }).catch((err) => this.dispatch(UserActions.RECEIVE_USER_FAILED, id, err));
  }
}
{% endsample %}

<h2 id="action-creators">Action creators</h2>

Our approach to defining [action creators](http://martyjs.org/v/0.8.15/guides/action-creators/index.html) was the source of many bugs and lots of confusion. We've got a new, simplified approach which should resolve all of these issues.

{% sample %}
classic
=======
var UserConstants = Marty.createConstants(["UPDATE_EMAIL"]);

var UserActionCreators = Marty.createActionCreators({
  id: 'UserActionCreators',
  updateEmail: function (userId, email) {
    this.dispatch(UserConstants.UPDATE_EMAIL, userId, email)
  }
});
es6
===
var UserConstants = Marty.createConstants(["UPDATE_EMAIL"]);

class UserActionCreators extends Marty.ActionCreators {
  updateEmail(userId, email) {
    this.dispatch(UserConstants.UPDATE_EMAIL, userId, email)
  }
}
{% endsample %}

<h2 id="one-render-per-store">Components only re-rendered once per action</h2>

There was an [interesting discussion in the Flux panel at React Conf about batching store updates to improve performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTj4O7WJJ98&list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr#t=473). Marty now does this automatically for you so no matter how many times your store changes your components will only be re-rendered once per action.

<h2 id="developer-tools">Developer Tools</h2>

[Marty Developer Tools]({% url /guides/developer-rools/index.html %}) has been given an overhaul. It can now tell you things like what components re-rendered as a result of the action and which stores caused a component to re-render. It also gives you the ability to reset the applications state to a specific action (think ``get reset --hard actionId``).

<a href="{% url /img/devtools-data-flow.png %}"><img src="{% url /img/devtools-data-flow.png %}" width="100%" alt="Marty Developer Tools"/></a>

<h2 id="lodash">lodash</h2>

Thanks to [@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton) we've moved from underscore.js to lodash (This is an internal change so wont effect you if you're using underscore in your application). This has resulted in a **6KB drop** in our gzipped file size. Unfortunately Marty has also grown by 6KB so Marty v0.9 is the same size as Marty v0.8 :(

<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>

For those currently using Marty v0.8, we've written a [guide for upgrading to v0.9]({% url /guides/upgrading/08_09.html %}).

###Breaking changes

``Store#setState`` has been renamed to [``Store#replaceState``]({% url /api/stores/index.html#replaceState %}). [``Store#setState``]({% url /api/stores/index.html#setState %}) will now merge the existing state with the new state. This is to more closely follow the React API.

**Bugs**

- Don't auto set content-type if using FormData ([#140](http://github.com/jhollingworth/marty/issues/140))
- Fetch API compatibility ([#133](http://github.com/jhollingworth/marty/issues/133))

###Deprecations

- [Invokable action creators]({% url /guides/action-creators/migrating-from-v8.html %})
- [State Mixin]({% url /guides/state-mixin/index.html %}), use [containers]({% url /guides/containers/index.html %}) instead.
