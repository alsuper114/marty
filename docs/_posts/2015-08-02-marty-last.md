I started working on Marty last year in response to my dissatisfaction with the existing Flux libraries out there. 9 months later I no longer feel the same way and so I'm sad to say Marty v0.10 will be the last major release. Truth be told I've [done a flummox](https://github.com/acdlite/flummox#40-will-likely-be-the-last-major-release-use-redux-instead-its-really-great) and started using [redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux). I recommend you check it out, it really is a better way of thinking about flux.

For those who have built apps on top of Marty, I'm sorry for the inconvinience. I recommend you look at migrating to [Alt](http://alt.js.org/), the differences between Marty & Alt are mostly superficial now. There are a few features missing however [@goatslacker](https://github.com/goatslacker) and [@taion](https://github.com/taion) are working on [migrating them over](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/issues/337). In the interim we will continue to accept pull requests and there will likely be the occasional patch.

I would like to say a big thank you to everyone who has helped work on Marty and improve the code base. Especially to [@taion](https://github.com/taion) who has been a constant source of help and pull requests.
